On job interview we perform code review for your code.

## Composer
You need Composer so grab instruction from

(https://getcomposer.org/)

All future commands are assumes composer installed globally

## PHP 7
You need to install php interpreter if you dont heve already :)

### Windows

### MAC OS X
PHP 7.0.0 can be installed using homebrew:
```
brew tap homebrew/dupes
brew tap homebrew/versions
brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php
brew install php70
```
Or you can install it via Liip's php-osx tool:

```

### Linux
(http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-linux-14-04-install-php7-using-apt-get-command/)

We don't need Nginx part

## Docker
Install Docker from one of instruction

(https://docs.docker.com/linux/)

(https://docs.docker.com/windows/)

(https://docs.docker.com/mac/)

Now We start docker
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
if everything goes green you should have see all containers started just type

```
docker ps
```
We are interested in php nginx and mysql containers.

Copy mysql CONTAINER_ID

```
docker inspect MYSQL_CONTAINER_ID
```
Now copy ip address of that container

## Install Vendors
Just Type
```
composer install
```
Don't mind post install errors (if you have php < 7).

Your db ip is copied MYSQL_CONTAINER_ID and password is password.

Everything else is defaults from parameters.yml.dist

## Add line in HOST file
add this line to host file in your system
```
127.0.0.1 localhost.dev
```

### Windows
Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista use User Account Control (UAC), so Notepad must be run as Administrator.

#### Windows 10 and 8
1. Press the Windows key.

2. Type Notepad in the search field.

3. In the search results, right-click Notepad and select Run as administrator.

4. From Notepad, open the following file: c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts

5. Make the necessary changes to the file.

6. Click File > Save to save your changes.

### Linux
1. Open a terminal window.

2. Open the hosts file in a text editor (you can use any text editor) by typing the following line:
```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

3. Enter your domain user password.

4. Make the necessary changes to the file.

5. Press Control-x.

6. When asked if you want to save your changes, answer y

### Mac OS X
1. Open Applications > Utilities > Terminal.

2. Open the hosts file by typing the following line in the terminal window:
```
sudo nano /private/etc/hosts
```
3. Type your domain user password when prompted.

4. Edit the hosts file.

The file contains some comments (lines starting with the # symbol), and some default hostname mappings (for example, 127.0.0.1 â€“ local host). Add your new mappings after the default mappings.

6. Save the hosts file by pressing Control+x and answering y.

7. Make your changes take effect by flushing the DNS cache with the following command:
